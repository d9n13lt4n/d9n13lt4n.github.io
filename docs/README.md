## Edit

Files could be edited/updated directly on GitHub using the following link `https://github.com/d9n13lt4n/d9n13lt4n.github.io/edit/main/docs/<file to edit>.md` using the GitHub's editor. GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files during every commit. Forced/manual rebuild is unavailable, but there are possible [workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24098792/how-to-force-github-pages-build).

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme ([hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)) you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/d9n13lt4n/d9n13lt4n.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `docs/_config.yml` configuration file. For more usage details, check out Jekyll's [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
